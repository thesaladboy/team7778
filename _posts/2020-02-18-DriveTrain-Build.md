The team built a 28.3” x 28” square chassis using the AM14U4 Kit of Parts Chassis. We chose a square chassis because we wanted a wider intake to make it easier on the driver, but did not want to risk tipping with the wide drive train. We included 2 CIM motors from our previous robot (2019 season) onto the new base. The organization of the brain and wires were done by our electrical team and were attached to a piece of wood through tracing the pieces and drilling done by mechanical. The assembling and cutting was done by both first and veteran FRC members with the veteran members assisting the first years. Completion of the chassis took about 3 days.
